Here are three testcases, in the lab, TA will ask you to do one of them.
                1st     2nd   3rd   4th   5th    6th   7th
testcase1: Ea0    Ad0  Aa5  Ft0   Ma5  Ag4  Kw4
testcase2: Ta0    Af0   Aa7  Pe0   Sa7   Ai2   Tk2
testcase3: Wa0  As0   Aa9  Sw0  Ka3   Ay6  Rm6

For each testcase, if you can finish the 7th picture (in the table), you don't need to do the others. 
If you can finish the 6th picture, you don't need to process the 2nd one and the 3rd one.
If you can finish the 5th picture, you don't need to process the 1st one and the 3rd one.
If you can finish the 4th picture, you don't need to process the 1st one and the 2nd one.

Hence, in fact, you need to process 3 pictures at most.
